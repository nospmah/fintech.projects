## Landscape:
***
<br>
Kraken is a US-based cryptocurrency exchange providing cryptocurrency to fiat trading for individual investors and institutions alike.
<br><br>

Ten years ago Bitcoin and cryptocurrency were considered to be on the fringe of the financial landscape with many suggesting Bitcoin was not a real asset and overly complicated. Further, the market was seen to be a bubble. However, as early adopters began to prove conventional wisdom wrong, cryptocurrency evolved into a huge, global market with hundreds of millions of accounts. This trend change was led by millennial investors with 18% owning cryptocurrency and 42% planning to buy Bitcoin in the next five years.
