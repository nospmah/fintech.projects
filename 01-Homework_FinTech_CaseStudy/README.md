## Business Activities

<br>

Founder Jesse Powell recognized the importance of Bitcoin from the onset and understood “that the exchange is the most critical part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.” Thus, Kraken is a cryptocurrency exchange that provides people the means to quickly and securely trade various cryptocurrencies. Similar in function to a stock exchange, cryptocurrency exchanges facilitate the buying and selling of virtual currencies by retail as well as large investors and traders. Participants are allowed to buy and sell cryptocurrency using various fiat currencies including the U.S dollar, Canadian dollars, euros, and the Japanese yen.

The Kraken mission statement reads:

<br>

> “Our mission is to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrency so that you and the rest of the world can achieve financial freedom and inclusion.”

<br>

Kraken aims to support individual investors ranging in experience from crypto-beginners to advanced traders. It does this by providing access to an ever-increasing number of cryptocurrency options as well as online tools and features. Additionally, Kraken also supports institutional investors, stating:

<br>

> “Kraken is the premier cryptocurrency investing solution for institutions of all sizes. We offer exceptional liquidity and competitive pricing for all our markets so you can achieve your investment goals quickly and confidently”

## Landscape

<br>

Ten years ago Bitcoin and cryptocurrency were considered to be on the fringe of the financial landscape with many suggesting Bitcoin was not a real asset and overly complicated. Further, the market was seen to be a bubble. However, as early adopters began to prove conventional wisdom wrong, cryptocurrency evolved into a huge, global market with hundreds of millions of accounts. This trend change was led by millennial investors with 18% owning cryptocurrency and 42% planning to buy Bitcoin in the next five years.

The space is now highly competitive with many companies competing for users. Kraken consistently ranks in the top 10 by volume.

## Results

<br>

According to CoinMarketCap, Kraken is the 4th largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world (as of September 2020) and widely considered as the most sophisticated, reputable and secure by participants and observers of cryptocurrency markets. One important claim that few other exchanges can make - Kraken has never been hacked!

Common metrics used to compare crypto exchanges include:
* Volume (24h)
* Markets
* Confidence score
* Available altcoins


As can be seen in the following chart, Kraken tops all competitors in confidence with a score of 79.18%. However, volume is limited as compared to other leaders based on the number of markets supported.

**In the news**

In September 2020 Kraken became the first digital asset company to receive a U.S. bank charter recognized under state and federal law. Through the charter, Wyoming will allow Kraken to form the world’s first Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI) named ‘Kraken Financial’, which will be regulated like any other bank. This means that customers of Kraken Financial will have traditional banking services for both fiat and digital assets including:
* Payment of bills in crypto
* Receiving salaries in crypto
* Adding digital assets to their investment and trading portfolios<br><br>

Speaking to Forbes, Chief Legal Officer at Kraken Marco Santori, said this:

> "I think it is difficult to state the over-importance of this milestone. I think this is a specific development in the course of crypto affairs. This represents the development of an efficient, transparent, responsible nexus between the world of traditional finance and the developing crypto ecosystem. I think this is a historical time and the kind of thing that students of finance and history will look back on as a watershed moment for the development of financial assets"

## Recommendations

<br>

It seems that one of the major drawbacks for users of the Kraken exchange is usabilty. 

* Hire UX engineers and improve website usability. The cost for this improvement would be minimul and could allow Kraken to reach many novice users and increase adoption.

* Add support for debit cards (Coinbase support this)

It appears the biggest obstacle to growth is the limited number of markets Kraken reaches. As compared to industry leader Binance (676 markets), Kraken only reaches 192 markets.
